You are slowly building up what I call a Personal Process Practice (3P), which isn't a new idea at all.
The purpose of your 3P is to gain objective insight into how you do things without killing your creativity and productivity. 
By simply tracking little metrics and making run charts to guide improvements you can drastically change how well you work. 
The risk though is that this will prevent you from hacking quickly or getting things done or that your 3P will become more work than your real work.
I did this for about four years of my programming career and it worked great to teach me about myself and how I work. 
It also cut through many of the lies that process advocates push. I had a simple way to actually test if some pundit's views on programming improved my personal productivity. 
i would say the only mistake I made was taking it much too seriously and killing my creativity for those four years.
This is why you're building an idea of your starting process and work environment in small quick hacks. 
You don't have time to collect complicated metrics and worry about exactly how you do things when there's only 45 minutes to get something done.
Later we'll focus on practices that require concentration, and you'll spend more time and gather slightly better metrics. 
As you work try not to let the metrics kill your creativity, flow, or well-being. If you hate collecting something, then don't do it. 
Find a way to automate it, or come up with another metric.
